# MiniCut

MiniCut is a local-first, AI-assisted rough-cutting tool for spoken videos. It turns a source video into a reviewable edit plan, then renders the approved timeline with deterministic media tooling.

## Product direction

The first supported workflow targets Chinese single-speaker videos such as tutorials, talking-head recordings, lectures, and podcasts. The initial product will focus on:

- word-timestamped transcription;
- removal of silence, filler, repetition, and false starts;
- duration- and style-aware edit planning;
- validated, reversible edit plans;
- subtitle and video export;
- human review before final delivery.

## Architecture

```text
Media input
    -> transcription
    -> transcript normalization
    -> semantic segmentation
    -> edit planning
    -> timeline validation
    -> FFmpeg rendering
    -> review and export
```

The model never invents media timestamps. It selects stable transcript segment identifiers; MiniCut resolves those identifiers to timestamps, validates the resulting timeline, and performs the actual cut.

## Current status

The media-ingestion and local-project foundation is complete, the Transcript v1 protocol is validated and versioned, and the MLX Whisper boundary enforces word timestamps. The next implementation step is mapping MLX output into Transcript v1.

## Development

Create or update the local environment, then run the complete quality gate:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python tools/check.py
```

## Development principles

- Build one testable behavior at a time.
- Require unit tests for every executable behavior.
- Keep model providers and media engines replaceable.
- Keep edit decisions explainable, reversible, and reproducible.
- Run locally by default; make cloud processing an explicit choice.
